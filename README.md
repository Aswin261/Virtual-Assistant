# Virtual-Assistant

For the robot to listen to our voice/speech pip install speechRecognition

To speak out, or text to speech pip install pyttsx3

For advance control on browser pip install pywhatkit

To get wikipedia data pip install wikipedia

To get funny jokes pip install pyjokes

This is the project which doesn't involve any GUI instead, I used to run this project in the IDE itself.

But while executing the command using pywhatkit and Wikipedia, It will be redirected to the browser and look for the desired result.
